## Project Overview

Telecom companies face significant revenue loss due to customer churn. This project uses data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning to build a predictive model that identifies at-risk customers. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model evaluation.

### Key Features:
- **Data Manipulation**: Cleaning and preprocessing data to prepare it for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations to understand customer behavior and churn patterns.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing various models including Logistic Regression and Random Forest for churn prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Library for machine learning and model evaluation.
